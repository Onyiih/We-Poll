# VISION

The first user(Initiator) initiates the question, each friend(Respondent) then recieves a notification that they have been prompted with a question and will see the options provided by the Initiator. They each select their answer and submit. The Initiator can then see the aggregate responses in realtime and make a decision accordingly.
